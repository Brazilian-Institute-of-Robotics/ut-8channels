### UT 8 CHANNELS

![ut-holder](img/ut-img.jpg)

To read the data and export to csv, type:

`python3 ut_8channels.py <filename>`

Just replace `<filename>` with the name of the file you want to export (don't forget to add the `.utd` suffix).

The output is a csv sheet with 8 columns (each for a sensor) and N rows, where N is the number of acquisitions. Each cell corresponds to an A-scan.
